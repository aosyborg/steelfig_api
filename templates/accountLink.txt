Hi NAME,

This notification is to let you know that USER has decided to join forces with you on
Steelfig. Essentially this means you two will not only share one wishlist but also have
access to the same messages and will share a slot on the schedule.

You can break this link at any time by visiting the "Who's Going" page and clicking the
"unlink" icon.
